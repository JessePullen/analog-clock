# Analog Clock

## About the Project

This was a personal project with the intention to practice some skills I have learned and learn some new skills.
I started out by making an analog clock with live updating hands based on the local time of the web browser and 
expanded the project to include some international cities for the additional clocks.

To achieve the moving hands on the clock the CSS transform property was used to rotate the html element based
on the continually updating getDate function. The getDate function provided the seconds, minutes and hours for
local time and for each city. To allow the hands to rotate from the centre a transparent gradient was used to 
halve the hand from a line spanning the diameter of the clock.
